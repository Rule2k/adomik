"yarn" to install dependencies

"yarn start" in "api" folder to start API

"yarn start" in root folder to start front-end

redux-dev-tools should be install on the browser otherwise the app will not work

exercice realised in about 6 / 7 hours


By default, the app show the data of all users. When submitting a search though, it will only show the actual results. (meaning if you have no result, it'll show nothing)
This was done on purpose as I think it's bad for user experience to see an empty table at the start of the application.
You can't submit an empty search.
You can reset the data of the app in case you want to see the data of all users again.
